4. Please describe anything else you learned or did for this assignment (i.e., above and beyond requirements)

This was a very interesting assignment. It actually took me several hours to get everything all working
and the three datasets. Since I had implemented some of the algorithms instead of used them on 
previous assignments, it took me a little extra time to figure out how to simply use them.
In going above and beyond, I spend extra time playing around with the attributes and trying to
get better results for the ensemble learning algorithms. I tried to find different parameters that
I could include. Surprisingly, the ensemble learning algorithms performed slightly worse or the same
as the stand alone algorithms. This confused me because it should have been the other way around. Regardless,
I tried a bunch of combinations of parameters but had a hard time getting the performace better.

5. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


6. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I feel like I reached the "E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements" status
due to the 3-4 hours I spent on it along with the extra parameter testing I did on the ensemble
learning algorithms. I also tried to use datasets that were a little more challenging to use since
they should have provided more interesting results.
